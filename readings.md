Read (on top of the weekly readings):

The kinetic poem "Taroko Gorge"
The electronic poem "The Gathering Cloud"
The hypertext fiction "First Draft of the Revolution"
The interactive fiction work "Shade"
"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the "Play IF card".

Read a few works from each volume of the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/):

* [Volume 1 (October 2006)](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/)
* [Volume 2 (February 2011)](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/)
* [Volume 3 (February 2016)](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/)
* [Volume 4 (June 2022)](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/)

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)
